## Contributing

We are a small group of programmers and we are always looking for suggestions on ways to improve our products. Feel free to post feature requests and bug reports on [iFixit Meta](http://meta.ifixit.com/) or send us pull-requests here on GitHub.

## Using

The easiest way to use these files is by embedding them from our CDN. More info can be found on [our site](http://www.ifixit.com/api/doc/embed), but two examples are:

### Embed the Kinect Teardown in your page

> &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ifixit.com/static/embed/ifixit-embed.js?id=4066&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

### Embed a banana pops recipe from Make: Projects in your page.

> &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ifixit.com/static/embed/make-embed.js?id=404&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
